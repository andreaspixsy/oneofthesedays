Meeting people is good to do. People love being recognised, and also recognising other people. It makes us human. Meeting people leads to great things. That new job you were looking for, sponsorship for your latest project, a new friend even.It's simply amazing where you meet people. I was sitting in a meeting today (funny, that) and someone came in who I had met a few weeks ago at an event. Neither of us knew that we had anything to do with the group we were both meeting with, but it just so happened that we did. I looked good, he looked good, and the group in the middle looked good as well. All because of a chance meeting, which only occurred because of a previous chance meeting, which only occurred.. you get the idea.So next time someone wants to have coffee with you, or invites you to some event, just go! Who knows who you will meet there.
