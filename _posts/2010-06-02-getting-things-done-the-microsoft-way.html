    <p>I recently took park in the world&rsquo;s largest technology competition, the Microsoft Imagine Cup. It&rsquo;s a competition that challenges students to use technology to solve the biggest problems of the world today. Quite a daunting and seemingly unsurmountble task, but clearly it seemed possible to the  300,000 students who entered worldwide.</p>

<p>Throughout the 6 months I was involved in the competition I learned many things, how to present well, how to gather feedback on ideas, how to work in a new team, etcetera. But above all else, the most important thing it taught me was how to ship.</p>

<p>(If any of you follow Seth Godin, you&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;m talking about.)</p>

<p>The imagine cup was an excuse to do something. We all have ideas, and we&rsquo;d love to seem them come to fruition. But doesn&rsquo;t that take time, effort (and super powers)? Of course it does! But that&rsquo;s the easy part.</p>

<p>We put hours and dollars into writing that work report, or doing our tax returns. Boring things that we don&rsquo;t want to do, but have to. Clearly we&rsquo;re good at putting in time and effort when we must.</p>

<p>So the hard part is getting the effort to go where we want it to. If we take that first step, and step onto the right platform however, it&rsquo;s easy. A competition was my (and my team&rsquo;s) step and platform, and it was fantastic.</p>

<p>As a result, the idea made it to the top 4 in New Zealand, has now transformed into a real business, and has opened up many opportunities for us to invest time and effort into something worthwhile.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re stuck with an idea and don&rsquo;t know how or where to start, find a competition that is related to it (there&rsquo;s bound to be one). This will give you the motivation, the environment, and an excuse, to start doing what you really want to do.</p>

<p>Besides, not only will your idea be coming to life, but you may even win something for it.</p>
