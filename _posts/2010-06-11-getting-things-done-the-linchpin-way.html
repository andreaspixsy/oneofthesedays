I wrote previously about how competitions are a <a href="http://www.oneofthesedaysblog.com/getting-things-done-the-microsoft-way">great way of getting things done</a>. There&rsquo;s a new method that&rsquo;s come up recently, and it&rsquo;s from Seth Godin&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162">Linchpin</a>. (If you haven&rsquo;t read it yet, stop reading this, buy it, start reading it, and hold on tight).</p>

<p>All you need is the desire to make a difference, and then the shipping will follow. Yukie is starting this on her blog, <a href="http://www.wearethelinchpins.com/">We Are The Linchpins</a> by encouraging people to show themselves. By creating an environment for people to make a difference, it&rsquo;s easy to get things done. You feel compelled to work because the work you&rsquo;re doing actually means something.</p>

<p>By joining the Linchpin community you become surrounded by people who strive to make a difference, who live to ship, and who love what they do. This keeps you inspired and motivated, and helps you aspire to be one as well.</p>

<p>If an excuse is what you need to get started, then have a look for a Linchpin meet up near you for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Linchpins-are-everywhere-raise-the-flag/">Linchpin Meetup Day on June 14</a>.</p>
