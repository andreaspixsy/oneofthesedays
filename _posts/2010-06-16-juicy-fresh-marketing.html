<p>It occurred to me today why <a href="http://www.jucy.co.nz/">Jucy Car Rentals</a> works. They have a brand that&rsquo;s cool, saucy, new, that people will want to show off. No one cares if you hired your car from Avis, or Budget, or another boring company. But if it&rsquo;s jucy, someone&rsquo;s going to ask about it. (If you haven&rsquo;t seen, they put suggestively posing women on the side of their campervans.)</p>

<p>This means that they can put advertising on the cars they rent out. It lets the renter tell a story, so why would they mind?</p>

<p>They can spend less on traditional (read: boring) advertising because they&rsquo;re not renting cars, they&rsquo;re renting mobile billboards, and so they can charge you less. Win-win.</p>

<p>Just like you can&rsquo;t out Amazon Amazon, you can&rsquo;t out Avis Avis. But if you&rsquo;re a backpacker, both the price point and the image is appealing, and so the choice is obvious.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve found their <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/01/how_to_be_remar.html">remarkable</a>.</p>
