    <p>In an effort to become competent with the Ruby on Rails framework, I&rsquo;ve decided to write up 1 tutorial per day for the next 30 days. Coming from a background in PHP, I will also try to add commentary on similarities/diffe:rences between the two languages. While not all of the topics I intend to cover are relevant to the Rails framework, and web development in general, the experience gained from learning them will hopefully be beneficial by increasing familiarity with the language and its paradigms. I hope that these tutorials become useful to anyone else who is wanting to learn Ruby/Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>The topics I will cover are:</p>

<p>  Array
  Enumerable</p>

<p>  IO</p>

<pre><code>pipe
tty
</code></pre>

<p>  Thread</p>

<pre><code>Mutex
Process
</code></pre>

<p>  Marshall
  Logger
  Observable
  Queue
  Singleton
  Zlib
  Test
  URI
  Yaml
  ERB
  Rails</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord
    Migrations
    Validations
    Associations
ActionMailer
ActionView
    Layouts
    View Helpers
ActionController
    Routing &lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(Some topics, such as Array and Enumerable, may be combined into a single tutorial as they are quite similar.)</p>

<p>These tutorials are designed for someone with reasonable programming experience. If you&rsquo;ve been using a language such as PHP for web development, but you feel like something is missing, then this is for you. Before starting the tutorials here, I strongly suggest you sit down in a comfortable chair, make a nice drink, and read through . It is unlike any programming guide you have ever read, and probably will ever read.</p>
