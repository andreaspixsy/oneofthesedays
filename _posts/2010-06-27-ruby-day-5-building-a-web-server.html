    <p>Looking through the upcoming topics that I plan to cover, I noticed a connection: they all cover important aspects of a web server. Threads let us handle multiple requests simultaneously, queues let us store pending requests and a mutex ensures that it won&rsquo;t become corrupted from multiple threads accessing it. We also need a way of logging requests, interpreting URLs, and certainly, we&rsquo;d like to test it to be sure it all works. So instead of covering the remaining topics in my proposed order, I will instead create sections of the web server that each focus on a different part of the Ruby API. Not only will this provide a more hands-on and relevant example, but it will also serve as a basic tutorial on how the HTTP protocol and web servers work. The resulting server will by no means be any competition to existing Ruby servers such as <a href='http://github.com/fauna/mongrel'>Mongrel</a> or <a href='http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/'>Thin</a>, but it will serve us well for the purposes of teaching.</p>
