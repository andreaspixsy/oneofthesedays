    <h3>One of These Days, this blog was going to change</h3>

<p>Puns aside, I&rsquo;ve now completely switched blogging platforms, migrating off of Wordpress to a custom <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> setup.
While wordpress was a seriously powerful platform, I was only using ~2% of its functionality, and that 2% wasn&rsquo;t doing quite
what I wanted. Now, with Jekyll, running on Sinatra on Heroku, I can hack things to work as needed. For example, posts
can be pre-processed with <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/">Docco</a> which creates the amazing styling on this page.</p>

<tr id='section-2'>
  <td class=docs>
    <div class="pilwrap">
      <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-2">&#182;</a>
    </div>
    <p>and the amazing styling of source code, like this &ndash;></p>
  </td>
  <td class=code>
    <div class='highlight'><pre><span class="n">reasons</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">reason</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">reason</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">explain</span>
<span class="k">end</span></pre></div>
  </td>

<tr id='section-3'>
  <td class=docs>
    <div class="pilwrap">
      <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3">&#182;</a>
    </div>
    <p>I figured it was worth the switch just for this alone, as most of the content is talking about source code.</p>
