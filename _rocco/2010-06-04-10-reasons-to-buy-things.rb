#  <strong>For Buying</strong>
# <ol>
# 	<li>You're rewarding the creator of the content for their invested time and effort.</li>
# 	<li>You're likely to get some physical packaging, especially if it's music. This is great if you like collecting things.</li>
# 	<li>It's the right thing to do, really.</li>
# 	<li>You might get freebies, like free upgrades or bonus tracks, or an author's signature.</li>
# 	<li>You'll likely get a support service if you're buying software.</li>
# 	<li>If you have a problem with what you've bought, you can ask the creator about it and get help.</li>
# 	<li>You can get credit card rewards points.</li>
# 	<li>It won't come with any nasty spyware or malicious parts.</li>
# 	<li>Some things simply aren't available anywhere other than from the original seller.</li>
# 	<li>It's not against the law.</li>

# <strong>For Pirating</strong>
# <ol>
# 	<li>If it's music, chances are the artist gets next to nothing. You're feeding blood sucking, soulless record companies.</li>
# 	<li>Packaging just takes up space. Digital copies are the way to go.</li>
# 	<li>It's not quite the right thing to do, but who's going to notice?</li>
# 	<li>The entire thing is a freebie.</li>
# 	<li>The given trial period or trial set of features might not be enough to convince you to buy it. After all, you don't want to buy something that's not quite right.</li>
# 	<li>If you have a problem with what you downloaded, you can just find another version elsewhere.</li>
# 	<li>I don't need a credit card.. the interest is outrageous!</li>
# 	<li>It won't come with any nasty DRM.</li>
# 	<li>Some things simply aren't available anywhere other than on torrent sites.</li>
# 	<li>It's not against the law in Russia.</li>
#  </ol>
