# Once you've downloaded it, you need to enter you Dropbox user ID. You can find this on your Dropbox folder online by going in to your shared folder, right clicking on a file and selecting "Copy public link". You then need to copy the number in the url, as shown below:

# ![Right click on a file from your public folder and choose 'Copy public link'](/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-07-at-7.54.54-PM.png)
# 
# ![Copy the number that's in the link. That's your Dropbox ID](/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-07-at-7.55.07-PM.png)
# 
# Once you've set this (in Preferences ? + ,) , you can then connect it to to one of your URL shortening accounts.
# 
# Note: The link didn't load first time round because Dropbox was trying to sync 5GB of files I had moved recently.
