title: DropShorty for Filesharing Awesomeness
---
Here's a quick demo of an awesome OSX app, <a href="http://beefdisciple.com/software/dropshorty/">DropShorty</a>.<object width="600" height="468"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uvhjZDfbe6Q&hl=en_US&fs=1&hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/uvhjZDfbe6Q&hl=en_US&fs=1&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="600" height="468"></embed></object>Once you've downloaded it, you need to enter you Dropbox user ID. You can find this on your Dropbox folder online by going in to your shared folder, right clicking on a file and selecting "Copy public link". You then need to copy the number in the url, as shown below:[caption id="attachment_132" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="Right click on a file from your public folder and choose \'Copy public link\'"]<a href="http://www.oneofthesedaysblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-07-at-7.54.54-PM.png"><img src="http://www.oneofthesedaysblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-07-at-7.54.54-PM.png" alt="" title="Copy dropbox public link" width="600" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-132" /></a>[/caption][caption id="attachment_133" align="aligncenter" width="536" caption="Copy the number that\'s in the link.
