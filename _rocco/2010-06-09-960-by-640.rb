That's the resolution of the newly announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 4</a>.5 years ago we were complaining that it was difficult to design websites that would fit old monitors. The old standard of 800x600 was simply too small to do anything useful with. The table layout, and then the fluid CSS layout helped us cope, but it was still hard to imagine that most people were seeing it through that size a window. Even today it's still hard to imagine people viewing content through such a resolution, because now they're doing it on a phone.Multi-tasking, video calling, and HD video are all amazing features, but this new screen is what really amazes me.We've gone from 480,000 pixels on a 15 inch, multiple kilogram weighing, ungainly behemoth of a screen, to over 600,000 pixels on something the size and weight of a pack of cards. Wow.
