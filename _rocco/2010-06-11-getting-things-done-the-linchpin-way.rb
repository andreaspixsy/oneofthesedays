There's a new method that's come up recently, and it's from Seth Godin's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162">Linchpin</a>. (If you haven't read it yet, stop reading this, buy it, start reading it, and hold on tight).All you need is the desire to make a difference, and then the shipping will follow. Yukie is starting this on her blog, <a href="http://www.wearethelinchpins.com/">We Are The Linchpins</a> by encouraging people to show themselves. By creating an environment for people to make a difference, it's easy to get things done. You feel compelled to work because the work you're doing actually means something.By joining the Linchpin community you become surrounded by people who strive to make a difference, who live to ship, and who love what they do. This keeps you inspired and motivated, and helps you aspire to be one as well.If an excuse is what you need to get started, then have a look for a Linchpin meet up near you for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Linchpins-are-everywhere-raise-the-flag/">Linchpin Meetup Day on June 14</a>.
