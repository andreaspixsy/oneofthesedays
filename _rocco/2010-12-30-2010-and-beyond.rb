title: 2010 and Beyond
---
The year being just about over, it's time to write one of those summary posts. I'll keep it brief!From starting my first company, to finishing a degree in Software Engineering, to starting full time freelancing, the year has been an almost overwhelming learning curve. I wouldn't, however, change a second of it. Thanks especially to the people I've met through study, work, meetups, twitter, and everywhere else; you've all been amazing, and helped make the year an absolute blast. Slightly drained now, I'm looking forward to a bit of recuperation, and then will be right back into it next year, 2011. To those of you who've visited me here I sincerely thank you, and I hope you'll stick around for a hopefully more frequent and interesting year of posting to come!Sam
