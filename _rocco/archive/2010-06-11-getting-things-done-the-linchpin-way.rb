# I wrote previously about how competitions are a [great way of getting things done](http://www.oneofthesedaysblog.com/getting-things-done-the-microsoft-way). There's a new method that's come up recently, and it's from Seth Godin's book, [Linchpin](http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162). (If you haven't read it yet, stop reading this, buy it, start reading it, and hold on tight).

# All you need is the desire to make a difference, and then the shipping will follow. Yukie is starting this on her blog, [We Are The Linchpins](http://www.wearethelinchpins.com/) by encouraging people to show themselves. By creating an environment for people to make a difference, it's easy to get things done. You feel compelled to work because the work you're doing actually means something.
# 
# By joining the Linchpin community you become surrounded by people who strive to make a difference, who live to ship, and who love what they do. This keeps you inspired and motivated, and helps you aspire to be one as well.

# If an excuse is what you need to get started, then have a look for a Linchpin meet up near you for [Linchpin Meetup Day on June 14](http://www.meetup.com/Linchpins-are-everywhere-raise-the-flag/).
